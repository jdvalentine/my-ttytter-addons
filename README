My modifications of Reuteras (https://github.com/reuteras) addons to the twitter client TTYtter.
If you like the sound of a command line twitter experience, you can
download the client from 

http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/

The current tools are:

/fsearch <string>
/limit
/later <tweet id> <description>

I am modifying /later so that it posts to Instapaper.com as a personal objective which might
be useful to others.

and information about these tools can be found at:
